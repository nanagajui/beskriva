# Beskriva - AI Content Creation Studio

## Overview

Beskriva is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that provides a unified content creation studio for all Lemonfox.ai API services. The application offers a chat-centric interface for orchestrating Speech-to-Text (Whisper), Text-to-Speech, Image Generation (Stable Diffusion XL), and Chat (Llama) capabilities with advanced document processing workflows. It's designed to work offline-first with no backend dependency, storing all data locally in the browser.

**Key Enhancement:** Content Processing Pipeline - Upload research PDFs, generate AI summaries, create podcast scripts for multiple speakers, produce TTS audio, and generate aligned cover images - all through conversational chat orchestration.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety and modern component patterns
- **Vite** as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling with dark/light theme support

- **Store Monoliths**: useDocumentStore combines documents, workflows, and templates (300+ lines)
- **Type Duplication**: Similar types defined across multiple files
- **API Patterns**: Inconsistent error handling and request patterns
- **Documentation Drift**: Implementation has grown beyond current documentation

### ðŸš§ Quality Improvement Progress (January 8, 2025)

**âœ… Completed Actions:**
- Created comprehensive quality assessment and refactoring plan (QUALITY_PLAN.md)
- Identified critical areas: 85 TypeScript files, 8,500+ lines, complex components
- Started type system consolidation with shared/types.ts (300+ unified types)
- Updated documentation to reflect actual codebase state vs. aspirational features
- Began component refactoring with custom hooks for business logic separation

**ðŸ”§ Active Refactoring Areas:**
- **Type Safety**: Consolidating duplicate types across 15+ files into shared/types.ts
- **Component Architecture**: Extracting business logic into custom hooks (useDocumentUpload)
- **Store Optimization**: Planning split of 300-line useDocumentStore into focused stores
- **API Standardization**: Unifying error handling patterns across API calls
- **Documentation Sync**: Ensuring replit.md accurately reflects implemented features

**ðŸ“Š Quality Metrics Target:**
- Component files < 150 lines (current: some >250 lines)
- Store files < 200 lines (current: useDocumentStore 300+ lines)  
- Zero TypeScript strict mode errors
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Comprehensive documentation coverage

**Next Priority**: Complete type consolidation and component hook extraction for DocumentUpload, TTS Panel, and Image Generation components.
