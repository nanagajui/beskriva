# Beskriva Codebase Audit Report
**Date:** January 8, 2025  
**Status:** CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

## üö® Critical Issues Found

### 1. Missing TabInfo for Workflow
**Problem:** Dashboard tabInfo object missing workflow entry, causing undefined subtitle errors
**Impact:** Workflow tab shows undefined subtitle in header
**Fix Required:** Add workflow entry to tabInfo

### 2. Import Resolution Failures  
**Problem:** Vite build failing to resolve component imports
**Impact:** Production deployment completely broken
**Fix Required:** Fix import paths and component exports

### 3. Store Integration Issues
**Problem:** Stores split between useDocumentStore and others but WorkflowPanel trying to access mixed data
**Impact:** Runtime crashes when accessing workflow tab
**Fix Required:** Consolidate store access patterns

### 4. Missing UI Components
**Problem:** Some shadcn components referenced but not fully implemented
**Impact:** Build-time failures and runtime crashes
**Fix Required:** Complete component implementations

## üîç Audit Findings

### Working Components ‚úÖ
- Basic app structure and routing
- Mobile navigation layout  
- Server startup and hot reload
- Core TypeScript compilation (dev mode)

### Broken Components ‚ùå
- Production build process
- Workflow tab functionality  
- Store state management consistency
- Component import resolution

## üöß Immediate Fix Plan

1. **Fix Dashboard tabInfo** - Add missing workflow entry
2. **Consolidate Store Access** - Ensure consistent store pattern
3. **Fix Import Issues** - Resolve component resolution failures
4. **Test Core Functionality** - Verify basic tabs work
5. **Fix Production Build** - Ensure deployment succeeds

## üìä Change Impact Analysis

**Since Phase 1A, these changes broke core functionality:**
- Store refactoring created inconsistent access patterns
- Component splitting left incomplete imports
- Build optimizations introduced resolution issues
- Type safety improvements created runtime errors

**Root Cause:** Rushed refactoring without testing each change incrementally
